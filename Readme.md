__init__.py
This file marks the package_analyzer directory as a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported. It also manages package initialization and can define package-level imports.

__main__.py
This is the entry point for running the package as a module. It imports and executes the main CLI functionality, enabling users to run the analyzer using the python -m package_analyzer command.

cli.py
This module implements the command-line interface using Typer. It processes user commands, handles command-line arguments and options, and coordinates the interaction between different components of the analyzer.

scraper.py
This module handles data retrieval from PyPI. It uses both the PyPI JSON API and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to gather comprehensive package information, including metadata, dependencies, and documentation details.

security_analyzer.py
This module performs security vulnerability analysis of packages. It queries security databases, analyzes vulnerabilities, and provides severity assessments and security recommendations.

utils.py
This module contains utility functions for formatting and displaying output. It uses the Rich library to create well-formatted tables and colored console output for package information and security reports.

visualizer.py
This module generates dependency graphs using Graphviz. It visualizes package dependency relationships in various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF).

Configuration Files:
- requirements.txt: Lists all project dependencies with their versions
- django_analysis.json and django_dependencies: Example output files from previous analyses

Available Commands:

1. Basic Package Analysis:
```bash
# Basic analysis with table output
python -m package_analyzer requests

# Analysis with specific version
python -m package_analyzer requests --version 2.31.0

# Output in JSON format
python -m package_analyzer requests --format json
```

2. Security Analysis:
```bash
# Security vulnerability check
python -m package_analyzer requests --security

# Security check with results saved to file
python -m package_analyzer requests --security --save
```

3. Dependency Visualization:
```bash
# Generate dependency graph
python -m package_analyzer requests --graph

# Generate detailed graph with custom depth
python -m package_analyzer requests --graph --depth 3

# Generate graph in specific format
python -m package_analyzer requests --graph --graph-format svg
```

4. Combined Analysis:
```bash
# Comprehensive analysis with all features
python -m package_analyzer requests --security --graph --format table --save

# Custom analysis with specific version and depth
python -m package_analyzer django --version 4.2 --security --graph --depth 2
```

Each command can be customized with various options to tailor the analysis to specific needs. The modular structure ensures that each component can work independently while also supporting integrated analysis when multiple features are needed simultaneously.
